# Stock Rating
Using past market performance, the script will calculate the standard deviation from the past week, and will then advise buy, sell or hold. The Yahoo Finance API is used, so there may be some limitations on what is able to be requested. Due to the data available from the API, only stocks are able to be scraped.

\* **Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future returns. This script does not provide financial advice.** \*

## Installation
1. Install the yahooFinance API 
``` 
pip3 install yFinance 
```
2. Run main.py and enter your ticker symbol
