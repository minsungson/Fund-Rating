# Fund Rating
Using past market performance, the script will calculate the standard deviation from the past week, and will then advise buy, sell or hold. The Yahoo Finance api is used, so there may be some limitations on which funds, stocks or shares are able to be scraped. 

\* **Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future returns. This script does not provide financial advice.** \*
